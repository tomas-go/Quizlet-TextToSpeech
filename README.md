# Quizlet-TextToSpeech
I have been really busy studying lately and I would like an option to have my flashcard notes read to me while I do other stuff like drive or workout. I use quizlet for creating flashcards and studying. I figured I could try and use web scraping and then some kind of text-to-speech to get the result I wanted. For now I am learning how to web scrap.

pip install selenium

pip install bs4

pip install gTTS 

install geckodriver and create a path.
